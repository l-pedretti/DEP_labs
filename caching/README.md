# Labs

## Lab 1: Setting Up Redis for Spring Boot Applications
**Objective:** Install and configure Redis to be used as a caching solution in a Spring Boot application.

**Instructions:**
- Install Redis on your local machine or use a cloud-based Redis service.
- Create a new Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr, adding the `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` dependency.
- Configure the Redis connection settings in the `application.yml` file (e.g., host, port).
- Implement a simple service that connects to Redis and performs basic operations, such as setting and getting a key-value pair.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will learn how to set up and configure Redis for use in a Spring Boot application.
- They will gain practical experience with basic Redis operations from within a Spring Boot context.

## Lab 2: Implementing Caching with Spring Boot and Redis
**Objective:** Use Redis to implement caching for a Spring Boot application.

**Instructions:**
- Extend the Spring Boot application from Lab 1 to include a RESTful API with a service that retrieves data from a simulated data source (e.g., a list of products).
- Implement caching using Springâ€™s `@Cacheable` annotation, with Redis as the cache provider.
- Test the caching mechanism by calling the endpoint multiple times and observing the reduction in response times after the initial request.
- Experiment with cache eviction strategies using the `@CacheEvict` annotation.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will understand how to implement caching in a Spring Boot application using Redis.
- They will learn to optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data.

## Lab 3: Distributed Caching Strategies with Spring Boot and Redis
**Objective:** Explore distributed caching strategies using Redis in a microservices architecture.

**Instructions:**
- Create two separate Spring Boot microservices that need to share cached data (e.g., a user service and an order service).
- Configure both services to use the same Redis instance for caching.
- Implement caching for shared data (e.g., user information) in the user service and retrieve it in the order service.
- Test the inter-service communication and ensure that the cache is utilized effectively to reduce load times.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Students will learn how to implement distributed caching in a microservices architecture using Redis.
- They will gain hands-on experience with sharing cached data across multiple services.
